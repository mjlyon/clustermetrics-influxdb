# clustermetrics-influxdb
A collection of scripts and tools that can be used to feed information from a Scale Computing cluster into telegraf as well as directly  into InfluxDB for visualization.

## Requirements
1.  InfluxDB already installed and configured.  I can provide some high-level configurations based on what I was using, but there are a number of good documents available, including the Installation section here: https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb
2.  An understanding of what you wish to measure
3.  Optional:  A tool to visuzliaze your data, if you wish.  In this case, we will be using grafana
